Several solutions exist to ensure the desired behavior:

**1.  Increased Specificity:** Make the `#container.special` even more specific, perhaps by adding a more specific class.  This makes the intended style more likely to win.

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
.container {
  width: 100%;
}

#container {
  width: 50%;
}

#container.special.override {
  width: 75%; /* More specific */
}
```

**2. !important (Use sparingly):** Use the `!important` flag. This is generally discouraged but helps to solve the problem if a change in order is not possible.

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
.container {
  width: 100%;
}

#container {
  width: 50%;
}

#container.special {
  width: 75% !important; /* Force override */
}
```

**3. Order of Styles:**  Place the more specific selectors later in the CSS file. This works because CSS is processed in the order that it is included. If the order cannot be modified, the other options are preferred.

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
.container {
  width: 100%;
}

#container {
  width: 50%;
}

#container.special {
  width: 75%;
} /* More specific selector later in file */
```

Choose the solution that best fits your project's coding style and maintainability standards. Avoid relying heavily on `!important` as it can reduce code readability and makes maintenance more difficult.
